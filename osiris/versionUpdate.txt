To change the version of Osiris, the following needs to be done:

1. Edit the image, OsirisAnalysis/Osiris*.png with the correct version.  
This is done by typing the version into wordart.doc, 
doing a print screen and paste into a blank graphic using MS-Paint
then copy/paste the version number into the osiris image.

2. Run f2d.pl in the OsirisAnalysis directory using the image file
name as the command line argument.  This will generate osiris_png.h
which is used for the splash screen.

3. In the setup project, in Setup1 directory, set the name of the
output .msi file to reflect the new version.

4. Edit Version/OsirisVersion.h to update the version.

   Rebuild ALL!

   On a UNIX machine, do a fresh CVS checkout of
   internal/osiris in a new directory.
   In the osiris directory run
   sh fix.sh
   This will move unwanted files out of the osiris directory

   in the internal directory build a source distribution

   cd ..
   tar zcvf ../dist/Osiris-[version]-source.tar.gz osiris

   Copy this source distribution to a mac and a PC, extract and build
   according to the instructions in the file: README

5. When distributing to the public or releasing a beta,
   update the web site in
   /net/mwebtest2/export/home/web/public/htdocs/projects/SNP/osiris

  Update the version info in version.cgi

6. For a non-public release, go to 
   /net/mwebtest2/export/home/web/public/htdocs/projects/SNP
   and run the following on the command line:

   ls -1 osiris/version.cgi >> .sink_thesefiles



7.  For a public dist. copy the distribution files into
    /net/mwebtest2/export/home/web/public/data/projects/SNP/osiris

   in /net/mwebtest2/export/home/web/public/htdocs/projects/SNP/osiris
   update getFile.cgi in
   and add/move links in index.html

   Test on http://mwebtest2.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/SNP/osiris/
   when it works, update using sinker as follows



   Go to /net/mwebtest2/export/home/web/public/data/projects/SNP
   run the following at the command prompt:

   ls -1 osiris/* >> .sink_thesefiles

   When .sink_thesefiles no longer exists, go to
   /net/mwebtest2/export/home/web/public/htdocs/projects/SNP
   and run the following

   ls -1 osiris/* >> .sink_thesefiles
